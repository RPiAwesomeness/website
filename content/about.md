# // About

Hey guys! I'm Nate Olander, a software developer from Michigan who loves exploring just about all areas of computers!

I've got a bunch of different projects kinda spread all over the place, but most of them can be found via

- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/RPiAwesomeness)
- [Github](https://github.com/RPiAwesomeness)

You can also read my random mutterings [via that little blue bird](https://twitter.com/nateolander)

# // Projects

Because I'm in school currently (gotta get that paper that says I'm smart enough to push keys!) I don't have a ton of time to work on personal projects. But here are a couple of my favorite projects I've worked on/am working on. Check 'em out!

- [CactusBot](https://github.com/CactusDev) - Okay, this is a bit more than just a bot, and I haven't been active on it in a while, but this a microservice-based chat bot originally created for the Mixer streaming platform. We've slowly been working to expand it to be able to support Twitch, Mixer, and Discord but that's not quiiiiite here yet. I was heavily involved in the original version of the bot and wrote the majority of [our API](https://github.com/CactusDev/CactusAPI). One of my biggest projects to date was [rewriting that API in Go](https://github.com/CactusDev/Xerophi), which was a really great learning experience, especially when it comes to REST API design and implementation.
- [CactusDev Branding](https://github.com/CactusDev/CactusAssets) - This is some of the branding/graphic design I did for CactusDev way back when we were just starting out. We had been using EmojiOne's cactus emoji as a logo and I said enough was enough and designed this. Probably the graphic design I'm most proud of to this day.
- [tinyrender](https://gitlab.com/RPiAwesomeness/tinyrender) - This is an OpenGL-esque software rendering application I am working on following [ssloy's tinyrenderer tutorial](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer). I find computer-generated graphics pretty cool, and this is a project that's letting me dip my toe in and learn a little!

# // Hobbies

- I play Ultimate Frisbee ... a lot. You should check it out, it's pretty awesome. Here's [just a taste of what it can be like](https://youtu.be/l2pIKSsersg).
- Graphic design. It's cool, I'm pretty buns at it, but I still love doing it and seeing the awesome things other people come up with!
- I write random bits of code for stuff I'm interested in (as evidenced by the myriad of projects on my Github/Gitlab accounts)
- I occasionally do [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/143623499@N04/)
- I'll mess with hardware projects, but haven't done anything of note just yet. I made an object avoiding robot once...I guess that's cool.
- Apparently I write blog posts or something? My old Wordpress blog is [over here](https://sudodblog.wordpress.com) and I'm actually pretty proud of some of those posts. I'll migrate them over eventually, but it stands as a monument to my dedication to writing way back in the day. I seem to have misplaced that, if you see it do let me know.
