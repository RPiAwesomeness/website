## Ohai!

I wrote a blog post. That's kinda cool...

This post is basically just me saying that I've actually got a blog up and running via Hugo! Ideally this will eventually be hosted on a Linode/DigitalOcean instance but for now I'm j-chillin on a free [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) instance because they're dope and apparently this is a thing I can do!

What will this be? Not entirely sure, but I was missing having the ability to blog about random programming things. Soooo with the free .tech domain I got through the Github student pack I was provided with a "little" project to work on (yeah I've sunk a lot of hours into this already...) and a kick in the rear to get writing again. I hope to be able to post about projects as I work on them, like my [tinyrender](https://gitlab.com/RPiAwesomeness/tinyrender) renderer project, and on little things I come across in my studies and at work.
