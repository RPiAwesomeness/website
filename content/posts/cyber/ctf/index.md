# HACKERS
What's your thought when you see that word? For most people they think of someone hiding in a dark and gloomy basement hunched over a computer with their face illuminated by the computer screen. This mysterious figure, likely wearing a hoodie, gloves, and possibly even a balaclava mask, is undoubtedly up to no good and should be arrested immediately.

Thankfully, that's not the only form of hacking that goes on. This is where 
ethical hackers come in. Commonly referred to as white hat hackers, these are people who use the same techniques and tools as the "bad guys" (referred to as black hat hackers) for good, finding and reporting bugs in software before the flaws can be abused.

# So what?
At the time of writing this I am pursuing a degree in computer science with an emphasis in cyber security. This blog is going to be my way of recording what I do and what I learn as I go.

I'm going to be going through and documenting what I have done so far and as I keep trying out new things and learning! The main thing thus far would be competing in the 2020 Spring National Cyber League competition for a class I was taking, but recently I found out about the bug bounty scene and have been spending a lot of time on the Hacker101 CTF site in an effort to learn.

So what will this be? Basically it'll be a lot of write-ups. Maybe it'll help out some people down the road to figure out problems that they're stuck on and it'll serve as a repository of info for myself!
